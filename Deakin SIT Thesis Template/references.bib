LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a ﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an inﬁnite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efﬁcient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classiﬁcation, and collaborative ﬁltering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

	abstract = {Humans are the final decision makers in critical tasks that involve ethical and legal concerns, ranging from recidivism prediction, to medical diagnosis, to fighting against fake news. Although machine learning models can sometimes achieve impressive performance in these tasks, these tasks are not amenable to full automation. To realize the potential of machine learning for improving human decisions, it is important to understand how assistance from machine learning models affects human performance and human agency. In this paper, we use deception detection as a testbed and investigate how we can harness explanations and predictions of machine learning models to improve human performance while retaining human agency. We propose a spectrum between full human agency and full automation, and develop varying levels of machine assistance along the spectrum that gradually increase the influence of machine predictions. We find that without showing predicted labels, explanations alone slightly improve human performance in the end task. In comparison, human performance is greatly improved by showing predicted labels ({\textgreater}20\% relative improvement) and can be further improved by explicitly suggesting strong machine performance. Interestingly, when predicted labels are shown, explanations of machine predictions induce a similar level of accuracy as an explicit statement of strong machine performance. Our results demonstrate a tradeoff between human performance and human agency and show that explanations of machine predictions can moderate this tradeoff.},

	abstract = {As the largest producing country of municipal solid waste ({MSW}) around the world, China is always challenged by a lower utilization rate of {MSW} due to a lack of a smart {MSW} forecasting strategy. This paper mainly aims to construct an effective {MSW} prediction model to handle this problem by using machine learning techniques. Based on the empirical analysis of provincial panel data from 2008 to 2019 in China, we ﬁnd that the Deep Neural Network ({DNN}) model performs best among all machine learning models. Additionally, we introduce the {SHapley} Additive {exPlanation} ({SHAP}) method to unravel the correlation between {MSW} production and socioeconomic features (e.g., total regional {GDP}, population density). We also ﬁnd the increase of urban population and agglomeration of wholesales and retails industries can positively promote the production of {MSW} in regions of high economic development, and vice versa. These results can be of help in the planning, design, and implementation of solid waste management system in China.},
