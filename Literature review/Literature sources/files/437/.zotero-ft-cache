    Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on various areas of human life. Hence, the coronavirus pandemic and its consequences are being actively discussed on social media. However, not all social media posts are truthful. Many of them spread fake news that cause panic among readers, misinform people and thus exacerbate the effect of the pandemic. In this paper, we present our results at the Constraint@AAAI2021 Shared Task: COVID-19 Fake News Detection in English. In particular, we propose our approach using the transformer-based ensemble of COVID-Twitter-BERT (CT-BERT) models. We describe the models used, the ways of text preprocessing and adding extra data. As a result, our best model achieved the weighted F1-score of 98.69 on the test set (the first place in the leaderboard) of this shared task that attracted 166 submitted teams in total.
